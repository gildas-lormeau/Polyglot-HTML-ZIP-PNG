# Introduction

This repository contains a presentation showing how to create HTML/ZIP/PNG polyglot files in JavaScript. This is a work in progress.

You can download the presentation (PDF) in:
 - [english](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/main/Presentation%20(en).pdf)
 - [french](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/main/Presentation%20(fr).pdf)

Here is the resulting file: [demo.zip.png.html](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/raw/main/demo.zip.png.html).

# Requirements

You must install [Deno](https://deno.com/) to run the scripts in the [`/steps`](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/tree/main/steps) folder.

Each step corresponds to a part whose title is numbered in green in the presentation. Comments in the code identify the changes made at each step.
