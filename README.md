This repository contains a presentation showing how to create HTML/ZIP/PNG polyglot files in JavaScript. This is a work in progress.

You can view the presentation in:

Here is the resulting file: [demo.png.zip.html](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/raw/main/demo.png.zip.html). This file is compatible with HTML, PNG, and ZIP. The image displayed at the center of the HTML page is the page itself but interpeted as PNG.
